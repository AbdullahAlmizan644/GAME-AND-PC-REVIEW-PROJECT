It\'s the 4th grader equivalent of a Wild West standoff—watching and waiting with a full dose of adrenaline for the other guy to make a move and (hopefully) catch whatever they throw your way. That\'s part of why Knockout City is so damn good. Having walked the hallowed grounds of the elementary school blacktop myself, I can feel the scratchy rubber deforming my face as my little Dodgebralwer gets gobsmacked by a supersonic sphere. I\'ve lived that! I can\'t say the same for the thousands of times I\'ve been shot or blown up in Call of Duty, thankfully.But schoolyard nostalgia isn\'t the only reason I\'ve been so obsessed with Knockout City over the past few days (I\'m pretty sure my friends are sick of me pitching them on it). Beneath its cartoony exterior is a dense combat language with multiple ball types, throw styles, fakeouts, and team tactics. You\'re also not limited to a chalk-drawn rectangle with a line in the middle. Knockout City has the framework of a team-based shooter with large arena-style maps, deathmatch modes, and heaps of cover, but its action has more in common with the medieval combat of Chivalry than any shooter.', 'New Bonk City', 'sell2.jpg', 'A good sign is that Velan is already doing a lot of things right. Presumably with the backing of EA, Knockout City was able to release a polished and complete brawler from day one. You don\'t have to wait for fundamental features to come around (though I would like a way to commend opponents for a good fight). Season 1\'s launch this week gave us the first taste of how modes will rotate in and out of playlists as well. The wacky mode on deck right now is a 4v4 TDM where there are no balls, so players have to use each other for every KO. The fun variant has already led to some fantastically tragic plays.  EA\'s decision to have a 10-day free trial period was also smart and has attracted an initial pool of over two million players. The game is $20 to keep or free if you\'re a Game Pass subscriber on console or PC, which is exactly how I\'ll be playing for months to come.  I hope a healthy chunk of those two million stick around, because Knockout City is simply excellent. I\'m endlessly impressed with how much careful consideration has gone into turning a playground pastime mostly ignored by videogames into a rich competitive romp. There\'s nothing quite like it, which is why you should really give it a shot for free while you can.', '2021-05-29 19:39:59.000000', 0, 'Admin'),

Defending yourself from the navy, attacking innocent people for loot, sailing around doing nothing more than looking for trouble… all present and correct. You don\'t have to be horrible on the high seas, but when it\'s made as fun as it is here, it\'s pretty darn tempting.\r\n\r\nWhile there\'s a story, it\'s not particularly deep, and could be comfortably summed up in a tweet (including spoilers). The important thing is that you go from member of the nautical monarchy to outlaw pirate with amusing speed, and terrorising strangers is more fun than living a life of luxury could ever have been. Exploring (and blowing up) this world in your ship is immensely satisfying, which is just as well; you never set foot on dry land.\r\n\r\nYou never really \'set foot\' anywhere. Ports are little more than a collection of menus for buying, selling and quest-gathering. Outside of these, the boat is essentially your avatar, controlled with a choice of three levels of camera zoom. The two furthest away give the impression of looking down on, and playing with, your own personal pirate playset.', 'KING OF SEAS REVIEW', 'king_of_sea.png', 'Controls are nice and simple. Speed is dictated by how many of your three sails you have unfurled (as well as wind direction), which means taking a few down for tight turns, which can come in handy during combat. Speaking of which, to begin with, you\'ll rely on your cannons. Shooting to the left or right of your ship, positioning and awareness of range is important. As is timing; they take a few seconds to reload each time. You can even concentrate on ruining a ship\'s sails first, thereby severely reducing their speed. Thankfully, though, this is a game with little interest in realism.  There\'s a huge number of upgrades to find, loot, and buy. Aspects such as hull, crew, and sails will affect attack and defence stats; but after a little while, you\'ll also start to come across special abilities, most of which are magical. It seems unlikely that real pirates were using flamethrowers and magical beams of energy, or summoning giant tentacles to attack their enemies from the sea, but I bet they would\'ve liked to. In King of Seas, most of these abilities allow you to attack ships from significant distance.  While even upgraded cannons have a surprisingly limited range, most of these abilities—cheerily explained away as magic, if they have any explanation at all—tend to have double the reach or more, and sometimes don\'t even require aiming. They work on a cooldown longer than that of your cannons, so can\'t be spammed, but have unlimited uses. Combat therefore becomes a case of chipping away ship health with cannons, while carefully selecting and timing your more powerful attacks in between shots.', '2021-05-29 19:52:06.000000', 0, 'Admin'),

With the fully upgraded mutations, you really do look like a shark from a horror film, which is basically what you are to all those hapless golfers.\r\n\r\nThe story of your shark\'s life (and Scaly Pete\'s) is provided by Chris Parnell of Saturday Night Live and Rick and Morty, and it\'s an enjoyable series of smoothly delivered narration, one-liners, pop-culture references on everything from Waterworld to the Fyre Festival to Arrested Development, and even a few genuine shark facts thrown in. I laughed a number of times while playing Maneater: Parnell has a supreme talent for sounding officious and informative even when he\'s spouting utter nonsense.\r\n\r\nIt\'s also really novel to progress from a newborn baby shark to a meg, to grow not just in your abilities but in physical size. The hammerhead sharks and gators which once battered me mercilessly as a youngster eventually became a zero-risk food source, posing no more threat to me than a seal or turtle. Holding a creature in my mouth that once dwarfed me is a damn satisfying feeling, and that kind of size progression is rare in RPGs.\r\n\r\nIt\'s just a shame the journey from infant to megashark isn\'t populated with a wider variety of activities.

And there\'s the added bonus of getting to watch your opponent\'s corpse comically cartwheel through the air when you blow one up.\r\n\r\nGiven the innovation and wonderful attention to detail visible throughout the game, it\'s incredibly frustrating to see some fundamentals fumbled. The default stick sensitivities for a controller are absolutely terrible, putting the onus on the player to calibrate them properly (something I was never able to do to my complete satisfaction). The maps, of which there are currently eight, are a little disappointing. Most are somewhat homogenous visually, with exceptions like Museum, which is the best by far in terms of assets, character, and topography.\r\n\r\nWhile there are only six weapons to choose from, this makes perfect sense in context. Each \'loop\' typically lasts for only 15 seconds, and the guns vary enough to allow you to adapt to the current state of the match. Want to defend clones from a distance? Rifle it is. Expecting close encounters? Grab a shotgun. Want to deny the enemy team a point while they\'re clustered together on the point? Grenade launcher. And so on.

(17, 'Gigabyte Launches Even Smaller Ultra-Compact Brix PCs', 'pc review', 'pc_review8.jpeg', 'Back in February, Gigabyte launched new Core i3, i5, and i7 versions of its ultra-compact Brix PC, all of which took advantage of Intel\'s 10th generation processors. Now three more Brix PCs are being added to the list, only this time they use 10nm Pentium and Celeron chips.\r\n\r\nGigabyte decided to use two Celeron chips and a Pentium Silver for these low power mini PCs. They measure just 46.8 by 112.6 by 119.4mm, making them slightly smaller than the Core models already introduced. Even so, you\'re getting support for up to 16GB of 2,933MHz memory and a choice of SATA M.2 and 2.5-inch storage options.\r\n\r\nThe highest performing of the three models is the GB-BMPD-6005, which uses a 10W Pentium N6005 chip running at 2GHz. The GB-BMCE-5105 instead uses a 10W Celeron N5105 chip also running at 2GHz, and the GB-BMCE-4500C uses a 6W Celeron N4500 running at 1.1GHz. The obvious question is why would anyone choose the 4500C over the other two models? Because, of the three, it\'s the only one that uses a fanless design and therefore should run completely silent.', 'Gigabyte Launches Even Smaller Ultra-Compact Brix PCs', 'pc_review8.2.jpeg', 'Gigabyte is aiming these new models at a wide range of users including for home, school, and office, but also for digital signage, kiosks, and for medical care purposes. As for performance, Gigabyte is boasting between a 38-60% gain over previous Pentium Silver and Celeron processors, with graphics also getting a boost thanks to the updated Intel UHD Graphics 605.\r\n\r\nOn the front of the case you\'ll find two USB 3.1 ports, one of which is Type-C, as well as headphone and microphone jacks. On the back are two more USB 3.1 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, Mini DisplayPort 2a, and a HDMI 2.0a port. Wireless connectivity comes in the form of 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2. As is typical with Brix PCs, Gigabyte includes a VESA bracket for mounting them on the back of a monitor. In fact, it looks as though the cooling will work best when mounted vertically.', '2021-05-29 11:48:06.000000', 0, 'Admin'),
(18, 'SILICON DREAMS', 'game review', 'silicondream.webp', 'Although Blade Runner has inspired three trillion and six movies, games, books, comics, albums, and cereals, only a tiny percentage of them have understood (or even tried to understand) the film. Hurling neon signs and Japanese words around does not constitute telling a cyberpunk story. Here, however, we have a game that not only understands Blade Runner, but thoroughly deserves to be mentioned alongside it. Y’know, like I just did.\r\n\r\nThe Voight-Kampff test is how blade runners determine whether an individual is human, or a human-seeming android. Silicon Dreams takes the idea of this test, and especially the machine involved in conducting it, and runs with it. It runs hard, it runs fast, and it runs with a hell of a lot of style. \r\n\r\n', 'SILICON DREAMS ', 'silicondream2.png', 'Your character is an android created with the sole purpose of running what is for legal reasons absolutely not a Voight-Kampff machine. Silicon Dreams (mostly) consists of a half dozen or so interrogations conducted with this machine. Usually you’ll be speaking with androids, but occasionally with a human. While you will at one point be inevitably tasked with determining whether somebody is human or android, the experience for the most part takes sharp turns into territory you’ll never see coming.\r\n\r\nWith no voice acting and relatively simple graphics, there is enormous pressure on the script. Which it lives up to—the writing is incredible. Somewhat ironically, each and every android I meet seems more human than most of the other characters I\'ve met in other games.\r\n\r\nThe depth and texture of the interview subjects is a vital part of the experience. I’m being pulled in several directions at once. Every interview has an accompanying report to be filled in and, for androids, one of three choices must be made: Release, send for maintenance (which guarantees a memory wipe), or destroy. Things are not nearly as simple as they appear, of course.\r\n\r\nThe company I work for is the manufacturer of these androids, and holds no sympathy for androids that begin to evolve emotionally. The individuals themselves, of course, have no desire to be memory wiped or, indeed, to die. Yet as an android myself, I am expected to toe the company line at all times. It’s made clear that any attempt to defy my employers, or provision of information that contradicts their expectations (intentionally or otherwise), will immediately cast suspicion on me. I am assessed for my performance after every interview. If my rating falls too low, I will be destroyed and replaced.', '2021-05-30 11:54:07.000000', 0, 'Admin'),
